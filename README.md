# Restivus [v0.8.4](https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kahmali/meteor-restivus.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kahmali/meteor-restivus)

#### REST APIs for the Best of Us!

Restivus makes building REST APIs in Meteor 0.9.0+ easier than ever before! The package is inspired
by [RestStop2][reststop2-docs] and [Collection API](https://github.com/crazytoad/meteor-collectionapi),
and is built on top of [Simple JSON Routes][json-routes] to provide:
- A simple interface for creating REST APIs
- Easy setup of CRUD endpoints for Mongo Collections
- User authentication via the API
  - Optional login and logout endpoints
  - Access to `this.user` in authenticated endpoints
  - Custom authentication if needed
- Role permissions for limiting access to specific endpoints
  - Works alongside the [`alanning:roles`][alanning-roles] package - Meteor's accepted role
    permission package
- **NEW!** API versioning via URL path
- And also planned:
  - JSON PATCH support on collections
  - Autogenerated OPTIONS endpoint on routes
  - Pre and post hooks on all endpoints

# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install Restivus using Meteor's package manager:
```bash
> meteor add nimble:restivus
```

## Quick Start

Often, the easiest way to explain something is by example, so here's a short example of what it's 
like to create an API with Restivus (keep scrolling for a JavaScript version): 

###### CoffeeScript:
```coffeescript
Items = new Mongo.Collection 'items'
Articles = new Mongo.Collection 'articles'

# Restivus is only available on the server!
if Meteor.isServer

  # Global API configuration
  Api = new Restivus
    useDefaultAuth: true
    prettyJson: true

  # Generates: GET, POST on /api/items and GET, PUT, DELETE on
  # /api/items/:id for the Items collection
  Api.addCollection Items

  # Generates: POST on /api/users and GET, DELETE /api/users/:id for
  # Meteor.users collection
  Api.addCollection Meteor.users,
    excludedEndpoints: ['getAll', 'put']
    routeOptions:
      authRequired: true
    endpoints:
      post:
        authRequired: false
      delete:
        roleRequired: 'admin'

  # Maps to: /api/articles/:id
  Api.addRoute 'articles/:id', authRequired: true,
    get: -> 
      Articles.findOne @urlParams.id
    delete:
      roleRequired: ['author', 'admin']
      action: ->
        if Articles.remove @urlParams.id
          status: 'success', data: message: 'Article removed'
        else
          statusCode: 404
          body: status: 'fail', message: 'Article not found'
```

###### JavaScript:
```javascript
Items = new Mongo.Collection('items');
Articles = new Mongo.Collection('articles');

if (Meteor.isServer) {

  // Global API configuration
  var Api = new Restivus({
    useDefaultAuth: true,
    prettyJson: true
  });

  // Generates: GET, POST on /api/items and GET, PUT, DELETE on
  // /api/items/:id for the Items collection
  Api.addCollection(Items);

  // Generates: POST on /api/users and GET, DELETE /api/users/:id for
  // Meteor.users collection
  Api.addCollection(Meteor.users, {
    excludedEndpoints: ['getAll', 'put'],
    routeOptions: {
      authRequired: true
    },
    endpoints: {
      post: {
        authRequired: false
      },
      delete: {
        roleRequired: 'admin'
      }
    }
  });

  // Maps to: /api/articles/:id
  Api.addRoute('articles/:id', {authRequired: true}, {
    get: function () {
      return Articles.findOne(this.urlParams.id);
    },
    delete: {
      roleRequired: ['author', 'admin'],
      action: function () {
        if (Articles.remove(this.urlParams.id)) {
          return {status: 'success', data: {message: 'Article removed'}};
        }
        return {
          statusCode: 404,
          body: {status: 'fail', message: 'Article not found'}
        };
      }
    }
  });
}
```

## Terminology

Just to clarify some terminology that will be used throughout these docs:

_**(HTTP) Method:**_
- The type of HTTP request (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

_**Endpoint:**_
- The function executed when a request is made at a given URL path for a specific HTTP method

_**Route:**_
- A URL path and its set of configurable endpoints

# Writing A Restivus API

**Restivus is a _server-only_ package. Attempting to access any of its methods from the client will 
result in an error.**

## Configuration Options

The following configuration options are available when initializing an API using 
`new Restivus(options)`:

##### `apiPath`
- _String_
- Default: `'api/'`
- The base path for your API. If you use `'api'` and add a route called `'users'`, the URL will be
  `https://yoursite.com/api/users/`.

##### `auth`
- _Object_
  - `token`  _String_
    - Default: `'services.resume.loginTokens.hashedToken'`
    - The path to the hashed auth token in the `Meteor.user` document. This location will be checked 
      for a matching token if one is returned in `auth.user()`.
  - `user`  _Function_
    - Default: Get user ID and auth token from `X-User-Id` and `X-Auth-Token` headers
        ```javascript
        function() {
          return {
            userId: this.request.headers['x-user-id'],
            token: Accounts._hashLoginToken(this.request.headers['x-auth-token'])
          };
        }
        ```
        
    - Provides one of two levels of authentication, depending on the data returned. The context
      within this function is the [endpoint context](#endpoint-context) without `this.user` and
      `this.userId` (well, that's what we're working on here!). Once the user authentication
      completes successfully, the authenticated user and their ID will be attached to the [endpoint
      context](#endpoint-context). The two levels of custom authentication and their required return
      data are:
      - Partial auth
        - `userId`: The ID of the user being authenticated
        - `token`: The auth token to be verified
        - If both a `userId` and `token` are returned, Restivus will hash the token, then,
          authentication will succeed if the `hashedToken`
          exists in the given `Meteor.user` document at the location specified in `auth.token`
      - Complete auth
        - `user`: The fully authenticated `Meteor.user`
        - This is your chance to completely override the user authentication process. If a `user` is
          returned, any `userId` and `token` will be ignored, as it's assumed that you have already
          successfully authenticated the user (by whatever means you deem necessary). The given user
          is simply attached to the [endpoint context](#endpoint-context), no questions asked.

##### `defaultHeaders`
- _Object_
- Default: `{ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }`
- The response headers that will be returned from every endpoint by default. These can be overridden 
  by [returning `headers` of the same name from any endpoint](#response-data). 

##### `defaultOptionsEndpoint`
- [_Endpoint_](#endpoint-configuration)
- Default: undefined
- If an endpoint is provided, it will be used as the OPTIONS endpoint on all routes, except those 
  that have one manually defined. This can be used to DRY up your API, since OPTIONS endpoints will
  frequently [respond generically](http://zacstewart.com/2012/04/14/http-options-method.html) across 
  all routes. 

##### `enableCors`
- _Boolean_
- Default: `true`
- If true, enables cross-origin resource sharing ([CORS]). This allows your API to receive requests 
  from _any_ domain (when `false`, the API will only accept requests from the domain where the API 
  is being hosted. _Note: Only applies to requests originating from browsers)._

##### `onLoggedIn`
- _Function_
- Default: `undefined`
- A hook that runs once a user has been successfully logged into their account via the `/login`
  endpoint. [Context](#endpoint-context) is the same as within authenticated endpoints. Any
  returned data will be added to the response body as `data.extra` (coming soon).

##### `onLoggedOut`
- _Function_
- Default: `undefined`
- Same as onLoggedIn, but runs once a user has been successfully logged out of their account via
  the `/logout` endpoint. [Context](#endpoint-context) is the same as within authenticated
  endpoints. Any returned data will be added to the response body as `data.extra` (coming soon).

##### `prettyJson`
- _Boolean_
- Default: `false`
- If `true`, render formatted JSON in response.

##### `useDefaultAuth`
- _Boolean_
- Default: `false`
- If `true`, `POST /login` and `GET /logout` endpoints are added to the API. See [Authenticating]
  (#authenticating) for details on using these endpoints.

##### `version`
- _String_
- Default: `null`
- URL path versioning is the only type of API versioning currently available, so if a version is 
  provided, it's appended to the base path of all routes that belong to that API  
    ```javascript
    // Base URL path: my-api/v1/
    ApiV1 = new Restivus({
      apiPath: 'my-api/',
      version: 'v1'
    });
    
    // Base URL path: my-api/v2/
    ApiV2 = new Restivus({
      apiPath: 'my-api/',
      version: 'v2'
    });
    ```

Here's a sample configuration with the complete set of options (for demo purposes only - using this 
configuration is not recommended):

###### CoffeeScript
```coffeescript
  new Restivus
    apiPath: 'my-api/'
    auth:
      token: 'auth.apiKey'
      user: ->
        userId: @request.headers['user-id']
        token: @request.headers['login-token']
    defaultHeaders:
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    onLoggedIn: -> console.log "#{@user.username} (#{@userId}) logged in"
    onLoggedOut: -> console.log "#{@user.username} (#{@userId}) logged out"
    prettyJson: true
    useDefaultAuth: true
    version: 'v1'
```

###### JavaScript
```javascript
  new Restivus({
    apiPath: 'my-api/',
    auth: {
      token: 'auth.apiKey',
      user: function () {
        return {
          userId: this.request.headers['user-id'],
          token: this.request.headers['login-token']
        };
      }
    },
    defaultHeaders: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    onLoggedIn: function () {
      console.log(this.user.username + ' (' + this.userId + ') logged in');
    },
    onLoggedOut: function () {
      console.log(this.user.username + ' (' + this.userId + ') logged out');
    },
    prettyJson: true,
    useDefaultAuth: true,
    version: 'v1'
  });
```

## Defining Collection Routes

One of the most common uses for a REST API is exposing a set of operations on your collections.
Well, you're in luck, because this is almost _too easy_ with Restivus! All available REST endpoints
(except `patch` and `options`, for now) can be generated for a Mongo Collection using
`Restivus#addCollection()`. This generates two routes by default:

**`/api/<collection>`**
- Operations on the entire collection
-  `GET` and `POST`

**`/api/<collection>/:id`**
- Operations on a single entity within the collection
- `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`

### Collection

The first - and only required - parameter of `Restivus#addCollection()` is a Mongo Collection.
Please check out the [Meteor docs](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/collections) for more on creating
collections. The `Meteor.users` collection will have [special endpoints]
(#users-collection-endpoints) generated.

### Collection Options

Route and endpoint configuration options are available in `Restivus#addCollection()` (as the 2nd,
optional parameter).

#### Route Configuration

The top level properties of the options apply to both routes that will be generated
(`/api/<collection>` and `/api/<collection>/:id`):

##### `path`
- _String_
- Default: Name of the collection (the name passed to `new Mongo.Collection()`, or `'users'` for
  `Meteor.users`)
- The base path for the generated routes. Given a path `'other-path'`, routes will be generated at
  `'api/other-path'` and `'api/other-path/:id'`

##### `routeOptions`
- _Object_
- `authRequired` _Boolean_
  - Default: `false`
  - If true, all endpoints on these routes will return a `401` if the user is not properly
    [authenticated](#authenticating).
- `roleRequired` _String or Array of Strings_
  - Default: `undefined` (no role required)
  - The acceptable user roles for all endpoints on this route (e.g., `'admin'`, `['admin', 'dev']`).
    Additional role permissions can be defined on specific endpoints. If the authenticated user does
    not belong to at least one of the accepted roles, a `403` is returned. Since a role cannot be
    verified without an authenticated user, setting the `roleRequired` implies `authRequired: true`,
    so that option can be omitted without any consequence. For more on setting up roles, check out
    the [`alanning:roles`][alanning-roles] package.

##### `excludedEndpoints`
- _String or Array of Strings_
- Default: `undefined`
- The names of the endpoints that should _not_ be generated (see the `endpoints` option below for a
  complete list of endpoint names).

##### `endpoints`
- _Object_
- Default: `undefined` (all available endpoints generated)
- Each property of this object corresponds to a REST endpoint. In addition to the
  `excludedEndpoints` list, you can also prevent an endpoint from being generated by setting its
  value to `false`. All other endpoints will be generated. The complete set of configurable
  properties on these endpoints is described in the [Endpoint Configuration](#endpoint-configuration)
  section below. Here is a list of all available endpoints, including their corresponding HTTP method,
  path, and a short description of their behavior:
  - `getAll` [_Endpoint_](#endpoint-configuration)
    - `GET /api/collection`
    - Return a list of all entities within the collection (filtered searching via query params
      coming soon!).
  - `post` _Endpoint_
    - `POST /api/collection`
    - Add a new entity to the collection. All data passed in the request body will be copied into
      the newly created entity. **Warning: This is unsafe for now, as no type or bounds checking is
      done.**
  - `get` _Endpoint_
    - `GET /api/collection/:id`
    - Return the entity with the given `:id`.
  - `put` _Endpoint_
    - `PUT /api/collection/:id`
    - Completely replace the entity with the given `:id` with the data contained in the request
      body. Any fields not included will be removed from the document in the collection.
  - `delete` _Endpoint_
    - `DELETE /api/collection/:id`
    - Remove the entity with the given `:id` from the collection.

#### Endpoint Configuration

By default, each of the endpoints listed above is `undefined`, which means it will be generated with
any default route options. If you need finer control over your endpoints, each can be defined as an
object containing the following properties:

##### `authRequired`
- _Boolean_
- Default: `undefined`
- If true, this endpoint will return a `401` if the user is not properly [authenticated]
  (#authenticating). If defined, this overrides the option of the same name defined on the entire
  route.

##### `roleRequired`
- _String or Array of Strings_
- Default: `undefined` (no role required)
- The acceptable user roles for this endpoint (e.g.,
  `'admin'`, `['admin', 'dev']`). These roles will be accepted in addition to any defined over the
  entire route. If the authenticated user does not belong to at least one of the accepted roles, a
  `403` is returned. Since a role cannot be verified without an authenticated user, setting the
  `roleRequired` implies `authRequired: true`, so that option can be omitted without any
  consequence. For more on setting up roles, check out the [`alanning:roles`][alanning-roles]
  package.

##### `action`
- _Function_
- Default: `undefined` (Default endpoint generated)
- If you need to completely override the default endpoint behavior, you can provide a function
  that will be executed when the corresponding request is made. No parameters are passed; instead,
  `this` contains the [endpoint context](#endpoint-context), with properties including the URL and
  query parameters.


### Request and Response Structure

All responses generated by Restivus follow the [JSend] format, with one minor tweak: failures have
an identical structure to errors. Successful responses will have a status code of `200`, unless 
otherwise indicated. Sample requests and responses for each endpoint are included below:

#### `post`
Request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/articles/ -d "title=Witty Title" -d "author=Jack Rose"
```

Response:

Status Code: `201`
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo",
    "title": "Witty Title",
    "author": "Jack Rose"
  }
}
```

#### `getAll`
Request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/articles/
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo",
      "title": "Witty Title!",
      "author": "Jack Rose",
    },
    {
      "_id": "7F89EFivTnAcPMcY5",
      "title": "Average Stuff",
      "author": "Joe Schmoe",
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `get`
Request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/articles/LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo",
    "title": "Witty Title",
    "author": "Jack Rose",
  }
}
```

#### `put`
Request:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/articles/LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo -d "title=Wittier Title" -d "author=Jaclyn Rose"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo",
    "title": "Wittier Title",
    "author": "Jaclyn Rose"
  }
}
```

#### `delete`
Request:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/articles/LrcEYNojn5N7NPRdo
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "Item removed"
  }
}
```

### Users Collection Endpoints

A few special exceptions have been made for routes added for the `Meteor.users` collection. For now,
the majority of the operations are limited to read access to the `user._id` and read/write access to
the `user.profile`. All route and endpoint options are identical to those described for all other
collections above. No options have been configured in the examples below; however, it is highly
recommended that role permissions be setup (or at the absolute least, authentication required) for
the `delete` endpoint. Below are sample requests and responses for the users
collection.

Create collection:
```javascript
Api.addCollection(Meteor.users);
```

#### `post`
Request:
`POST http://localhost:3000/api/users`
```json
{
  "email": "jack@mail.com",
  "password": "password",
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Jack",
    "lastName": "Rose"
  }
}
```
_Note: The only fields that will be recognized in the request body when creating a new user are
`email`, `username`, `password`, and `profile`. These map directly to the parameters of the same
name in the [Accounts.createUser()](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_createuser) method, so
check that out for more information on how those fields are handled._

Response:

Status Code: `201`
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a",
    "profile": {
      "firstName": "Jack",
      "lastName": "Rose"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `getAll`
Request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "nBTnv83sTrf38fFTi",
      "profile": {
        "firstName": "Anthony",
        "lastName": "Reid"
      }
    },
    {
      "_id": "oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a",
      "profile": {
        "firstName": "Jack",
        "lastName": "Rose"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `get`
Request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a",
    "profile": {
      "firstName": "Jack",
      "lastName": "Rose"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `put`
Request:
`PUT http://localhost:3000/api/users/oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a`
```json
{
    "firstName": "Jaclyn",
    "age": 25
}
```
_Note: The data included in the request body will completely overwrite the `user.profile` field of
the User document_

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "_id": "oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a",
    "profile": {
      "firstName": "Jaclyn",
      "age": "25"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `delete`
Request:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/oFpdgAMMr7F5A7P3a
```
Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "User removed"
  }
}
```


## Defining Custom Routes

Routes are defined using `Restivus#addRoute()`. A route consists of a path and a set of endpoints
defined at that path.

### Path Structure

The `path` is the 1st parameter of `Restivus#addRoute`. You can pass it a string or regex. If you
pass it `test/path`, the full path will be `https://yoursite.com/api/test/path`.

Paths can have variable parameters. For example, you can create a route to show a post with a
specific id. The `id` is variable depending on the post you want to see such as "/articles/1" or
"/articles/2". To declare a named parameter in the path, use the `:` syntax followed by the parameter
name. When a user goes to that URL, the actual value of the parameter will be stored as a property
on `this.urlParams` in your endpoint function.

In this example we have a parameter named `_id`. If we navigate to the `/post/5` URL in our browser,
inside of the GET endpoint function we can get the actual value of the `_id` from
`this.urlParams._id`. In this case `this.urlParams._id => 5`.

###### CoffeeScript:
```coffeescript
# Given a URL like "/post/5"
Api.addRoute '/post/:_id',
  get: ->
    id = @urlParams._id # "5"
```
###### JavaScript:
```javascript
// Given a URL "/post/5"
Api.addRoute('/post/:_id', {
  get: function () {
    var id = this.urlParams._id; // "5"
  }
});
```

You can have multiple URL parameters. In this example, we have an `_id` parameter and a `commentId`
parameter. If you navigate to the URL `/post/5/comments/100` then inside your endpoint function
`this.urlParams._id => 5` and `this.urlParams.commentId => 100`.

###### CoffeeScript:
```coffeescript
# Given a URL "/post/5/comments/100"
Api.addRoute '/post/:_id/comments/:commentId',
  get: ->
    id = @urlParams._id # "5"
    commentId = @urlParams.commentId # "100"
```

###### JavaScript:
```javascript
// Given a URL "/post/5/comments/100"
Api.addRoute('/post/:_id/comments/:commentId', {
  get: function () {
    var id = this.urlParams._id; // "5"
    var commentId = this.urlParams.commentId; // "100"
  }
});
```

If there is a query string in the URL, you can access that using `this.queryParams`.

###### Coffeescript:
```coffeescript
# Given the URL: "/post/5?q=liked#hash_fragment"
Api.addRoute '/post/:_id',
  get: ->
    id = @urlParams._id
    query = @queryParams # query.q -> "liked"
```

###### JavaScript:
```javascript
// Given the URL: "/post/5?q=liked#hash_fragment"
Api.addRoute('/post/:_id', {
  get: function () {
    var id = this.urlParams._id;
    var query = this.queryParams; // query.q -> "liked"
  }
});
```

### Route Options

The following options are available in `Restivus#addRoute` (as the 2nd, optional parameter):
##### `authRequired`
- _Boolean_
- Default: `false`
- If true, all endpoints on this route will return a `401` if the user is not properly
  [authenticated](#authenticating).

##### `roleRequired`
- _String or Array of Strings_
- Default: `undefined` (no role required)
- A string or array of strings corresponding to the acceptable user roles for all endpoints on
  this route (e.g., `'admin'`, `['admin', 'dev']`). Additional role permissions can be defined on
  specific endpoints. If the authenticated user does not belong to at least one of the accepted
  roles, a `403` is returned. Since a role cannot be verified without an authenticated user,
  setting the `roleRequired` implies `authRequired: true`, so that option can be omitted without
  any consequence. For more on setting up roles, check out the [`alanning:roles`][alanning-roles]
  package.

### Defining Endpoints

The last parameter of `Restivus#addRoute` is an object with properties corresponding to the supported
HTTP methods. At least one method must have an endpoint defined on it. The following endpoints can
be defined in Restivus:
- `get`
- `post`
- `put`
- `patch`
- `delete`
- `options`

These endpoints can be defined one of two ways. First, you can simply provide a function for each
method you want to support at the given path. The corresponding endpoint will be executed when that
type of request is made at that path.

For finer-grained control over each endpoint, you can also define each one as an object
containing the endpoint action and some addtional configuration options. 

#### Endpoint Configuration

An `action` is required when configuring an endpoint. All other configuration settings are optional, 
and will get their default values from the route.

##### `action`
- _Function_
- Default: `undefined`
- A function that will be executed when a request is made for the corresponding HTTP method.

##### `authRequired`
- _String_
- Default: [`Route.authRequired`](#authrequired-1)
- If true, this endpoint will return a `401` if the user is not properly
  [authenticated](#authenticating). Overrides the option of the same name defined on the entire
  route.

##### `roleRequired`
- _String or Array of Strings_
- Default: [`Route.roleRequired`](#rolerequired-1)
- The acceptable user roles for this endpoint (e.g.,
  `'admin'`, `['admin', 'dev']`). These roles will be accepted in addition to any defined over the
  entire route. If the authenticated user does not belong to at least one of the accepted roles, a
  `403` is returned. Since a role cannot be verified without an authenticated user, setting the
  `roleRequired` implies `authRequired: true`, so that option can be omitted without any
  consequence. For more on setting up roles, check out the [`alanning:roles`][alanning-roles]
  package.

###### CoffeeScript
```coffeescript
Api.addRoute 'articles', {authRequired: true},
  get:
    authRequired: false
    action: ->
      # GET api/articles
  post: ->
    # POST api/articles
  put: ->
    # PUT api/articles
  patch: ->
    # PATCH api/articles
  delete: ->
    # DELETE api/articles
  options: ->
    # OPTIONS api/articles
```

###### JavaScript
```javascript
Api.addRoute('articles', {authRequired: true}, {
  get: {
    authRequired: false,
    action: function () {
      // GET api/articles
    }
  },
  post: function () {
    // POST api/articles
  },
  put: function () {
    // PUT api/articles
  },
  patch: function () {
    // PATCH api/articles
  },
  delete: function () {
    // DELETE api/articles
  },
  options: function () {
    // OPTIONS api/articles
  }
});
```
In the above examples, all the endpoints except the GETs will require [authentication]
(#authenticating).

#### Endpoint Context

Each endpoint has access to:

##### `this.user`
- _Meteor.user_
- The authenticated `Meteor.user`. Only available if `authRequired` is `true` and a user is 
  successfully authenticated. If not, it will be `undefined`.

##### `this.userId`
- _String_
- The authenticated user's `Meteor.userId`. Only available if `authRequired` is `true` and a user is 
  successfully authenticated. If not, it will be `undefined`.

##### `this.urlParams`
- _Object_
- Non-optional parameters extracted from the URL. A parameter `id` on the path `articles/:id` would be
  available as `this.urlParams.id`.

##### `this.queryParams`
- _Object_
- Optional query parameters from the URL. Given the URL `https://yoursite.com/articles?likes=true`,
  `this.queryParams.likes => true`.

##### `this.bodyParams`
- _Object_
- Parameters passed in the request body. Given the request body `{ "friend": { "name": "Jack" } }`,
  `this.bodyParams.friend.name => "Jack"`.

##### `this.request`
- [_Node request object_][node-request]

##### `this.response`
- [_Node response object_][node-response]
- If you handle the response yourself using `this.response.write()` or `this.response.writeHead()`
  you **must** call `this.done()`. In addition to preventing the default response (which will throw
  an error if you've initiated the response yourself), it will also close the connection using
  `this.response.end()`, so you can safely omit that from your endpoint.

##### `this.done()`
- _Function_
- **Must** be called after handling the response manually with `this.response.write()` or
  `this.response.writeHead()`. This must be called immediately before returning from an endpoint.

  ```javascript
  Api.addRoute('manualResponse', {
    get: function () {
      console.log('Testing manual response');
      this.response.write('This is a manual response');
      this.done();  // Must call this immediately before return!
    }
  });
  ```
  
##### `this.<endpointOption>`
All [endpoint configuration options](#endpoint-configuration-1) can be accessed by name (e.g., 
`this.roleRequired`). Within an endpoint, all options have been completely resolved, meaning all 
configuration options set on an endpoint's route will already be applied to the endpoint as
defaults. So if you set `authRequired: true` on a route and do not set the `authRequired` option on 
one if its endpoints, `this.authRequired` will still be `true` within that endpoint, since the 
default will already have been applied from the route. 

#### Response Data

You can return a raw string:
```javascript
return "That's current!";
```

A JSON object:
```javascript
return { json: 'object' };
```

A raw array:
```javascript
return [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ];
```

Or include a `statusCode` or `headers`. At least one must be provided along with the `body`:
```javascript
return {
  statusCode: 404,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
    'X-Custom-Header': 'custom value'
  },
  body: 'There is nothing here!'
};
```

All responses contain the following defaults, which will be overridden with any provided values:

##### statusCode
- Default: `200`

##### headers
- Default:
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `*`
    - This is a [CORS-compliant header][cors] that allows requests to be made to the API from any 
      domain. Without this, requests from within the browser would only be allowed from the same 
      domain the API is hosted on, which is typically not the intended behavior. This can be 
      [disabled by default](https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus#enablecors), or also by 
      returning a header of the same name with a domain specified (usually the domain the API is 
      being hosted on).


## Versioning an API

We can't always get an API right on the first try (in fact, most people don't). Eventually, we 
find ourselves needing to maintain different versions of our API. This allows clients to convert at 
their own convenience, while providing the latest and greatest API to those ready to consume it.  

Currently, there is only a single versioning strategy supported in Restivus: URL path versioning. In
this strategy, the version of the API is appended to the base path of all routes belonging to that 
API. This allows us to easily maintain multiple versions of an API, each with their own set of 
configuration options. Here's a [good write-up]
(http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/02/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is.html) on some of the 
different API versioning strategies.

###### CoffeeScript
```coffeescript
# Configure first version of the API
ApiV1 = new Restivus
  version: 'v1'
  useDefaultAuth: true
  prettyJson: true

# Maps to api/v1/items and api/v1/items/:id
ApiV1.addCollection Items
  routeOptions: authRequired: true

# Maps to api/v1/custom
ApiV1.addRoute 'custom', 
  get: ->
    'get something'
    
# Configure another version of the API (with a different set of config options if needed)
ApiV2 = new Restivus
  version: 'v2'
  enableCors: false

# Maps to api/v2/items and api/v2/items/:id (with auth requirement removed in this version)
ApiV2.addCollection Items
  
# Maps to api/v2/custom (notice the different return value)
ApiV2.addRoute 'custom',
  get: ->
    status: 'success'
    data: 'get something different'
```

###### JavaScript
```javascript
// Configure first version of the API
var ApiV1 = new Restivus({
  version: 'v1',
  useDefaultAuth: true,
  prettyJson: true
});

// Maps to api/v1/items and api/v1/items/:id
ApiV1.addCollection(Items, {
  routeOptions: { authRequired: true }
});

// Maps to api/v1/custom
ApiV1.addRoute('custom', {
  get: function () {
    return 'get something';
  }
});
    
// Configure another version of the API (with a different set of config options if needed)
var ApiV2 = new Restivus({
  version: 'v2',
  enableCors: false
});

// Maps to api/v2/items and api/v2/items/:id (with auth requirement removed in this version)
ApiV2.addCollection(Items);
  
// Maps to api/v2/custom (notice the different return value)
ApiV2.addRoute('custom', {
  get: function () {
    return {
      status: 'success',
      data: 'get something different'
    };
  }
});
```

## Documenting an API

What's a REST API without awesome docs? I'll tell you: absolutely freaking useless. So to fix that,
we use and recommend [apiDoc][]. It allows you to generate beautiful and extremely handy API docs
from your JavaScript or CoffeeScript comments. It supports other comment styles as well, but we're
Meteorites, so who cares? Check it out. Use it.

# Consuming A Restivus API

The following uses the above code.

## Basic Usage

We can call our `POST /articles/:id/comments` endpoint the following way. Note the /api/ in the URL
(defined with the api_path option above):
```bash
curl -d "message=Some message details" http://localhost:3000/api/articles/3/comments
```

## Authenticating

**Warning: Make sure you're using HTTPS, otherwise this is insecure!**

### Default Authentication

_Note: To use the default authentication, you must first [create a user with the `accounts-password` 
package](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/accounts_passwords). You can do this with Restivus if you 
[setup a POST collection endpoint for the `Meteor.users` collection](#users-collection-endpoints)._

#### Logging In

If you have `useDefaultAuth` set to `true`, you now have a `POST /api/login` endpoint that returns a
`userId` and `authToken`. You must save these, and include them in subsequent requests. In addition 
to the `password`, the login endpoint requires one of the following parameters (via the request 
body):
- `email`: An email address associated with your `Meteor.user` account
- `username`: The username associated with your `Meteor.user` account
- `user`: **Note: This is for legacy purposes only. It is recommended to use one of the options 
  above.** Accepts either of the options listed above. Restivus will (very naively) attempt to 
  determine if the value provided is an email, otherwise it will assume it to be the username. This 
  can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

A login will look something like

```bash 
curl http://localhost:3000/api/login/ -d "username=test&password=password"
```

And the response will look like
```javascript
{ status: "success", data: {authToken: "f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ", userId: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ} }
```

You'll need to save the `userId` and `token` on the client, for subsequent authenticated requests.

#### Logging Out
  
You also have an authenticated `POST /api/logout` endpoint for logging a user out. If successful, the
auth token that is passed in the request header will be invalidated (removed from the user account),
so it will not work in any subsequent requests.
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/logout -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ" -H "X-User-Id: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ"
```

#### Authenticated Calls

For any endpoints that require the default authentication, you must include the `userId` and
`authToken` with each request under the following headers:
- X-User-Id
- X-Auth-Token

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ" -H "X-User-Id: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ" http://localhost:3000/api/articles/
```

# Upgrading Restivus

To update Restivus to the latest version:
```bash
> meteor update nimble:restivus
```

Or to update Restivus to a specific version:
```bash
> meteor add nimble:restivus@=<version_number>
```

For example, to update restivus to v0.7.0:
```bash
> meteor add nimble:restivus@=0.7.0
```

Please check the [change log][restivus-change-log] before updating, for more information about the 
changes between each version. More detailed instructions for updating between major versions are 
included below.

## Upgrading to 0.8.0

The most noticeable difference in v0.8.0 is that Restivus is now exported as a "class" instead of an 
object. API configuration has also been moved from `Restivus.configure()` (which has been removed), 
to the Restivus constructor. This means that instead of being forced to configure a single Restivus 
API with

```javascript
Restivus.configure({
  apiPath: 'only-api',
  ...
});

Restivus.addRoute('example');
```

you can configure as many separate APIs as you need with

```javascript
FirstApi = new Restivus({
  apiPath: 'first-api',
  ...
});

SecondApi = new Restivus({
  apiPath: 'second-api',
  ...
});

// Maps to /first-api/example
FirstApi.addRoute('example', ...);

// Maps to /second-api/example
SecondApi.addRoute('example', ...);
```

This update makes it possible to [maintain multiple versions of an API](#versioning-an-api). 

One other significant (but not API-breaking) change is that [`iron:router`][iron-router] has been 
replaced by [`simple:json-routes`][json-routes] as the server-side router for Restivus. This means 
that Restivus should no longer [interfere with other routers]
(https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus/issues/24) (client _or_ server), or do other [annoying]
(https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus/issues/35) [things]
(https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus/issues/43). Special thanks to [Sashko Stubailo]
(https://github.com/stubailo) for his work on `simple:json-routes`, and for handling the conversion 
from `iron:router` to `simple:json-routes` in Restivus! 

Some other notable changes are:
- The `deleteAll` collection endpoint has been removed, as it had the potential to be quite
  destructive, and is not a standard REST endpoint
- `useAuth` API config option renamed to `useDefaultAuth`
- More accurate response codes returned in API

For a complete list of changes, check out the [change log]
(https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md#v080---2015-07-06).

## Upgrading to 0.7.0

**_WARNING!_ All clients consuming a Restivus API _with the default authentication_ will need to 
reauthenticate after this update**

Restivus used to store the account login token in the `Meteor.user` document at 
`services.resume.loginTokens.token`. Now, to match Meteor's current implementation, the account 
login token is stored as a hashed token at `services.resume.loginTokens.hashedToken`. This means 
that all clients using the default authentication in a Restivus API will need to reauthenticate with 
their username/email and password after this update, as their existing tokens will be rendered 
invalid.

## Upgrading to 0.6.1

Restivus v0.6.1 brings support for easily generating REST endpoints for your Mongo Collections, and
with that comes a few API-breaking changes:

- The `Restivus.add()` method has been changed to `Restivus.addRoute()` for clarity, now that the
  `Restivus.addCollection()` method has been added.
- All responses generated by Restivus now follow the [JSend] format, with one minor tweak: failures
  have an identical structure to errors (check out the [JSend documentation][jsend] for more details
  on the response structure, which will be demonstrated throughout these docs). Just to be clear,
  this only affects responses that are automatically generated by Restivus. Any responses you
  manually created will remain unaffected.
