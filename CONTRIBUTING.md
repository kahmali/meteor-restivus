## Code Contributions

Contributing code to an open source project can be fun and rewarding, especially when it's done
right. Check out the guidelines below for more information on getting your changes merged into a
release.


### Pull Requests

All pull requests should be made to the `dev` branch, unless **all** changes in the request are to
the README or CHANGELOG **and** all of those changes are already reflected in the latest released
version. If that's the case, the pull request should be made to `master`. If you're not familiar
with [forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [pull requests]
(https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), please check out those resources for more
information.


### Committing

Limit commits to one related set of changes. If you’ve worked on several without committing, use
[`git add -p`](http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/git-add/) to break it up into multiple commits.

Try to start and finish one related set of changes in a commit. If your set of changes spans
multiple commits, use interactive rebase [`git rebase -i`]
(https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase-i) to squash the commits
together.

### Commit Messages

Please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
  - _Note: Rarely, only the subject line is necessary_

For a detailed explanation, please see [How to Write a Git Commit Message]
(http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules).
